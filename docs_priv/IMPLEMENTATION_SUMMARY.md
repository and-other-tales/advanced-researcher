# Dynamic Document Ingestion Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds the ability for users to dynamically create new knowledge bases by ingesting documents from web sources, including GOV.UK sites. The system allows the user to specify a website or sitemap URL, and the application will crawl, extract, process, and store the content in a vector database for later retrieval.

## Key Components

1. **Dynamic Ingestion Module** (`dynamic_ingest.py`)
   - Implements web crawling and document extraction
   - Provides specialized extraction for GOV.UK pages
   - Handles creation of vector store collections
   - Manages document chunking and indexing

2. **API Routes** (`dynamic_routes.py`)
   - Endpoints for listing, creating, retrieving, and deleting knowledge bases
   - Manages knowledge base metadata
   - Bridges between the API and the ingestion functionality

3. **Dynamic Chain Integration** (`dynamic_chain.py`)
   - Extends the existing LangChain pipeline to support multiple knowledge bases
   - Allows selecting different retrievers at query time based on the knowledge base ID
   - Ensures compatibility with both local and cloud deployments

4. **Modified Core Components**
   - Updated `chain.py` and `local_chain.py` to support knowledge base selection
   - Extended `ChatRequest` model to include optional knowledge base ID
   - Integrated the dynamic chain into the existing LangServe routes

5. **Testing and Documentation**
   - Added `test_dynamic_ingest.py` for testing the ingestion functionality
   - Created `DYNAMIC_INGEST.md` documentation with API and usage details
   - Updated README.md to reference the new feature

## Usage Workflow

1. **Create a Knowledge Base:**
   ```
   POST /api/knowledge_bases
   {
     "name": "HMRC Tax Guidance",
     "source_type": "gov_uk",
     "url": "https://www.gov.uk/hmrc/internal-manuals",
     "max_depth": 8
   }
   ```

2. **Receive Knowledge Base ID:**
   ```
   {
     "collection_id": "hmrc_tax_guidance_1234abcd",
     "document_count": 150,
     "status": "success",
     "message": "Successfully ingested 150 documents..."
   }
   ```

3. **Ask Questions Using the Knowledge Base:**
   ```
   POST /chat
   {
     "question": "What is the tax treatment of dividends?",
     "knowledge_base_id": "hmrc_tax_guidance_1234abcd"
   }
   ```

## Implementation Details

### Document Ingestion

- Uses LangChain's `SitemapLoader` and `RecursiveUrlLoader` to extract documents
- Implements custom extractors for different site types, with special handling for GOV.UK
- Chunks documents using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` with appropriate overlap
- Indexes documents in either Weaviate (cloud) or Chroma (local) vector stores

### Knowledge Base Management

- Stores knowledge base metadata in memory (would be extended to a database in production)
- Assigns unique IDs to each knowledge base for reference
- Supports filtering by user ID for multi-user scenarios

### Chain Architecture

- Uses a wrapper chain that dynamically selects the appropriate retriever
- Maintains compatibility with the existing configurable LLM architecture
- Preserves all existing functionality while adding knowledge base selection

## Future Enhancements

1. **Persistent Metadata Storage**: Replace in-memory knowledge base storage with a database
2. **Progress Tracking**: Add progress tracking for long-running ingestion jobs
3. **User Interface**: Add UI components for knowledge base management
4. **Additional Source Types**: Support more specialized extractors for different website types
5. **Content Filters**: Allow specifying content filters during ingestion

## Testing

The implementation includes a test script (`test_dynamic_ingest.py`) that demonstrates the ingestion of GOV.UK HMRC manuals. This allows for quick verification of the functionality before integrating with the full application.

## Conclusion

This implementation enables dynamic, on-demand creation of knowledge bases from web sources, with special support for GOV.UK content. It integrates seamlessly with the existing LangChain application architecture and provides a foundation for future enhancements.
